study performs molecular dynamics md simulations investigate structural features diffusion properties fullerene water suspensions numerical reveal organized structure liquid water formed close surface fullerene molecule changing solid liquid interfacial structure organized structure formation pronounced fullerene size reduced observation implies transition zone exists organized liquid water layers random distribution region structural stability fullerene water suspensions improves fullerene volume fraction increases insensitive fullerene size finally simulation reveal diffusion coefficient water molecules varies linear function fullerene loading independent fullerene size
